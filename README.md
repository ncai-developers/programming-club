### Basic Repository Procedures
Using [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) in order to organize all of our changes into branches coming off of development. The basic gist is this:
* **Master** is production ready whenever, and should only be changed with a major merge from `development`.
* **Development** is the branch where `features`, `hotfixes`, and `release` branch off from. Making a change involves creating the correct branch, working on it there, then merging it into `development` and NOT `master`.

Commit your changes to your branch and merge it into development when you think it's ready to be merged.
The rule for merging is to let others approve and merge it, not yoruself.
